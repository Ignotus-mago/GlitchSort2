-- fixed path to degrade file. In MacOS Mavericks, Eclipse Luna release, the default path for saving application files 
   was not the expected "bin" directory but the Applications folder where Eclipse IDE was located. Setting Preferences 
   did not clear up the problem, so I fixed it by creating a "projPath" variable. Not a problem in Processing.
-- fixed unsnap issue where images came up blank after resizing in munge method. Typical scenario for
   error: load an image, load a snap buffer image with different dimensions, fft the image, munge, 
   then display snap buffer. I added an alpha channel to the resized image in munge method.
-- rewrote and optimized color channel shifting code to handle arbitrary shift values. Nice array rotate algorithm.
   Added necessary controls to Munge control panel.
-- refactored references to "LowFreqCut" and LowFrequencyCut to set "link" attribute. Linked FFT boost and cut values
   are a little inaccurate, probably due to rounding errors, but I'm going to live with it for now.
